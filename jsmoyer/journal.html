			<h4>Wednesday March 4th, 2015</h4>

			<p>In class we learned about how to add values to a array using push and unshift and how to take away a value using shift and pop. You can use this to add values to an array without actually changing the array in the code if that is how your program works. In a game a value might need to be added after the game starts push and unshift can be used to add these values.</p>

			<p>I figured out how to use a while loop and make the answers to a prompt show up in the html as they are being answered. I did this by putting the prompt and innerhtml in the for and while tag. </p>

			<p>I started figuring out bootstrap. I am trying to make my JavaScript Project 1 better with bootstrap and will probably do something with my review project too. Bootstrap is pretty confusing to figure out, but I will get it eventually.</p>

			<p>I looked at three websites</p>
			<p>1.</p> <a href="http://spacecraftforall.com/">Site 1</a>
			<p>This website was really cool. You could move the 3D point of view with the mouse and it looked really cool. The only bad thing about it was that it was a little confusing trying to figure out what you were looking at.</p>
			<p>2.</p> <a href="http://www.dunckelfeld.de/en/.de">Site 2</a>
			<p>This was the website of a web designer, I think. It had a cool loading screen but there was not much to look at after that.<p>
			<p>3.</p> <a href="http://timeshift165.com/">Site 3</a>
			<p>The website had a game on it. It had a very cool introduction but I was not very good at the game.</p>
