				<p class="entry">Went online and searched up websites that offered a modern look through what is possible to construct with html/css/javascript. These are the sites that I looked at.</p>
				<hr>
				<a href="http://www.sonorans-valley.com/">Sonorans-valley</a>
				<hr>
				<p class="entry">This site allows you to travel to any place in the world and augments it into a desolate wasteland ravaged by a sandstorm, the major problem is that is gets extremely repetitive quickly. The layout/navigation bar beforehand is well done but beyond that I find it hard that it won a award.</p>
				<hr>
				<a href="http://www.masitupungato.com/">Masitupungato</a>
				<hr>
				<p class="entry">Although this is a massive advertisment for a vineyard it offers a seemless transition throughout the site as you scroll down the page more information flows into the page. The navigation bar is a clickable option that fades onto the foreground and the actually site dims down. The most glaring annoyance is that when the site loads there is a loading screen that lasts absolutely forever.</p>
				<hr>
				<a href="http://kurokawawonderland.jp/">Kurokawa Wonderland</a>
				<hr>
				<p class="entry">Once again there is a loading screen that forces you to wait until you can actually get into the site so there's that. The navigation bar flows from the left side that gives small information you can look at and click on to continue learning. The main page is a ongoing video that lets you jump around from portion to portion teaching you the "day in the life" of a person  that lives in Kurokawa, Japan. Mild annoyance is that the video timer appears over the video every time you re-enter the site and forces you to click away from it.</p>

				<p>Transitioned the original journal from it's "Review Project" folder into the currently working RPS game folder to mess around with it to get it working with BootStrap. Got the basic outlines finished with that and the connecting buttons but next week will consists of styling it to make it more appealing it to look at. The addition of forms will come next week as well as we get the final rubric and infomation on how ot implement them.</p>

				<p>Organized final project files into a folder named "Final Project", I know creative right? Deleted some files that were not needed anymore and moved files into their respective "css" and "js" folders. Made the forms and submit button look nice when the window is resized to any factor. More to tidy up on both Wednesday and Friday and will hopefully have it at a state where I can submit it</p>
