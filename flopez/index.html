<p>The reason why I made website the way I did was because it looked good. The way I made my website layout was because I looked at other websites and thought that it look good form the way I compared it, which was by looking to see if the colors came close to matching with other parts of the website. Also there are parts of the website that I made from previously did. I think I have learned a lot from this class, I didn't know anything at the start of the school year. This class should in my opinion have a second year, because there is much that we didn't learn because this is a first year class.</p>
