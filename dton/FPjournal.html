				<p>Looked at website and see what feature we liked
					
					<div class="linkweb">
					<a href="http://framesoflife.armani.com/the-campaign/en-us/kelly">Armani</a>
					<p>This website was interesting neat, it had many pop-up/slide navigation bar which was pretty cool. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to use your mouse wheel to scroll down to things. The feature I want to use from this website is the menue bar, additional navigation menu and the layout. </p>



					<a href="http://www.weareshepherd.com/">Sheperd</a>
					<p>I didn't really like this website but I liked some of its feature such as the search function and the layout, although it was friendly to use.</p>


					<a href="http://sozodesign.co.uk/">Sozo</a>
					<p>Out of the 3 I liked this website the most because the color scheme they chosen was really good and how the animation for the menu and navigation was really nice.</p>
