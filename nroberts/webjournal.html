			<h3>March 6th, 2015</h3>
				<p> 
					We worked in small groups to create a for loop asking the user ice cream flavors and display the user's answers on the page. We then took notes on for and while loops and after modified the for loop and turned it into a while loop.

			<h3>April 17th, 2015 </h3>
				<p> One site I entered a site caled<a href="http://www.timeshift165.com/">WWW.timeshift165.com</a>. It had many cool effects that popped up frequently and had many interactive elements like pulling the sheet off of the car. However the controls were slow to respond and it did not scale to mobile very well. <a href="https://taphome.com/">www.taphome.com</a> was another site I entered. It had a cool text animation were tthey faded and slid in when you scrolled down to it. Like timeshift it did not respond well to a mobile platform well. A third site was <a href="http://www.esvet.si/">www.esvet.si</a> that had cool animations in the background and an interactive model on one page. It also had images pop in when you reached text that related to them  and it did respond to being on mobile but it could have been done better.

			<h3>May 8th, 2015 </h3>
				<p>I began working on my final project for the end of the year by putting bootstrap into my rock paper scissors game, my web journal, and my homepage for the review project.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journalWrapper">
			<h3>May 11th, 2015 </h3>
				<p>We looked at the rubric for the final project of the year and saw what we needed to code for the website. We also looked at Mr. Jamieson's example of the final project.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journalWrapper">
			<h3>May 13th, 2015 </h3>
				<p>We learned to code forms in html and javascript. Then we worked on our projects.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="journalWrapper">
			<h3>May 18th, 2015 </h3>
				<p>We worked on organizing our final project files and worked on merging preexisting files with bootstrap..</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="journalWrapper">

		<div class="journalWrapper">
			<h3>May 22th, 2015 </h3>
				<p>We worked on our final projects for this class and adding the two types of forms to our projects.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journalWrapper">
			<h3>June 5th, 2015 </h3>
				<p>We worked on our final projects for this class. I got both forms to work and added a color scheme to the page. The class had a total of 8 people in it due to seniors graduating so it was a much quiter day than usual in codeing.</p>
		</div>

			<h3>June 8th, 2015 </h3>
				<p>Today is the final skinny monday of the year. Today I got he bio down onto the page, However Im having trouble putting style on it because something is getting in the way and Im thinking some bit of bootstrap is interfeering. So if the bio has white text, a black border, and a grey baackground you know that ive fixed it before wednesday.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="journalWrapper">
			<h3>June 10th, 2015 </h3>
				<p>Today is the final B day of the year and the day we submit our final projects on github. I finally was able to fix the styling on the forms and the bio paragraph with help from MR. Jamieson. IT turned out to be a problem with saving the file and everytime I saved, it saved to the old location instead of the new one in the css file.</p>
