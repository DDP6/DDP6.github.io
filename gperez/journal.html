				<h4>The Summary of the Day:</h4>

				<p>Today I worked on visually showing the list of favorite foods on a list on the browser.
				<ul>What I did:
					<li>I learned about Document.write()</li>
					<li>I learned about Document.getElementById().innerHTML</li>
					<li>I learned how to use onclick="function_name"</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>What I failed to do:
					<li>I could not get onclick and innerHTML to work on a list item</li>

				<h4>The Summary of the Day:</h4>

				<p> Today I watched the screencasts, took notes on the various types of variables in javascript, and examined for-loops in javascript. I created the files for Logic Challenge 1 and got a working for-loop to present the various values in an array to the browser.</p>

				<h4>Notes:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Strings - collection of characters wrapped in qoutes</li>
						<li>Numbers - both integers and floats</li>
						<li>Undefined - assigned no value or type</li>
						<li>Null - currently has no value but should</li>
						<li>Booleans - True/False (used for logic)</li>

					<ul>
						<li>objectname.length</li>
					</ul> 
					The Methods we reviewed for strings are:
					<ul>
						<li>variablename.toUpperCase()</li>
						<li>message.toLowerCase()</li>
					</ul>
					The Methods we reviewed for numbers are:
					<ul>
						<li>Math.ceil()</li>

				<h3>Friday, March 6th, 2015</h3>

				<h4>The Summary of the Day:</h4>

				<p>Today We did a group challenge to use a for loop to print the contents of an arrays (which were defined by the user through the use of prompts) into an html document. I then tested the ability create the same code without the use of arrays and just using a single variable instead of an array and a variable. I then created a simliar body of code that used a while loop to do the same. I then refigured the while loop so that it created list items in an unordered list for each value in the array.</p>

				<h3>Monday, March 9th, 2015</h3>

				<h4>The Summary of the Day:</h4>

				<p>Today we were assigned the first javascript project. I looked over the rubric, I watched the screewncast on it, I created both html pages and filled them with most of the basic structure as well as began a css file for the styling. I also organized everything in to the proper folders</p>

				<h3>Wednesday, March 11th, 2015</h3>

				<h4>The Summary of the Day:</h4>

				<p>Made lunch, ate a bite of it then got to work finishing the basic styling of the webpages, cleaned up the html code then began work on the javqascript code. so far the code does create lists once a button is clicked on screen, one list uses a for loop the other uses a while loop. so far I've not used the function push for the arrays because this leads to issues, in future must clear array before re-generating list.

				<h3>Friday, March 13th, 2015</h3>

				<h4>The Summary of the Day:</h4>

				<p>Finished up the Javascript projectct 1 today. added a button and function that pop up a picture of a gerbil onto the screen when clicked. I then went through and added comments to my javascript code. all of this project is now working, I question the interactivity points but it has the same amount as the example shown to us so I suspect its fine. I also lack the bonus points for changing the style but I'm satisfied without doing that aspect of it.
