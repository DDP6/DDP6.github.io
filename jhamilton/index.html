Creating this site was not an easy thing to do. The parts of it weren't hard, but putting them all together in a way that worked and didn't look ugly was pretty hard. Most of the time whatever was wrong was a simple spelling mistake, or a word that should be capitalized but isn't. The navigation bar gave me far more trouble then the rest of the site, I had to make some changes, such as making the current page not appear on the navbar. The reason the navbar was so hard is because I still don't fully understand the code behind it, as its bootstrap and I don't have the time to look at all of bootstrap's code bit by bit. I also am very fond of cats/kittens, as show by my choice of pictures in my projects. So here's a few cat pictures like the ones I would/did use in a project.</p>
